**One Click Shed Reloader** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) v1.4x mod which lets you harvest and reload
all supported containers in a Shed, Barn, or Coop with a single click on the outside of the building.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2052).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
Hover the cursor over a supported building to get instant info about the containers in the building that are ready
to harvest and reload:

Move closer to the building and left-click the outside to harvest all ready containers within:

If you are holding an item that can be loaded into an empty container within the building, it will be loaded automatically
when left-clicking the building.  This can be done at the same time as harvesting which makes managing buildings full of
containers much easier!

This mod allows you to take full advantage of all available space within your Shed or Barn since there is never a need to
enter it again!

## Notes
This mod does not affect your save game files in any way. There are no known compatibility issues with this mod, but there could be problems
with any mod that displays information while hovering the cursor over a building, or with mods that handle click events on buildings. If you 
discover any problems while using the mod, you can log an issue on the [BitwiseJon GitHub page](https://github.com/bitwisejon/StardewValleyMods/issues).
Only U.S. English text is provided at this time.
